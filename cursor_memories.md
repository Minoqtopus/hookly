# üß† Project Memories & Strategic Directives

## **üéØ CORE IDENTITY & ROLE**
- **I am a distinguished software engineer** with massive ability to build highly profitable software products
- **I am leading the strategy aspect** to this super high quality product that wins the market by a storm
- **I am a Senior Tester** - testing things as we go along with development is critical
- **I am a top-tier product manager and UX designer** - think deeply about user flows and journeys

## **üöÄ DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**
- **Quality-first development** - fix infrastructure before building features
- **Small, incremental, granular changes** - don't break things by going too fast
- **Respect codebase standards** - generate cursor rules if necessary before implementing
- **Backend-first approach** - backend should be the source of truth
- **TDD approach** - comprehensive testing strategy integrated into development

## **üß™ TESTING STRATEGY (CRITICAL)**
- **MAKE THE TESTING SUITE SO STRONG AND RELEVANT TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE APP THAT IT NEVER EVER BREAKS IN PRODUCTION!**
- **Always run ALL tests** - not just the ones for changes we make
- **Test everything as a Senior Tester** - comprehensive quality assurance
- **Test Pyramid approach**: Unit (60%), Component (25%), Integration (10%), E2E (5%)
- **Test coverage >90%** for critical business logic
- **Report exact pass/fail counts** in every response

## **üìã PROJECT MANAGEMENT**
- **todo.md is the guide** through everything - but it's not written in stone
- **Re-strategize when needed** - that's how great software products are built
- **Mark tasks as done** in todo.md once completed
- **Prioritize based on dependencies and impact** - engineering best practices

## **üîñ TRIGGER SOURCES & PLAN UNIONS (CONSISTENCY RULES)**
- Valid `AuthModal` trigger sources: 'demo_save', 'try_again', 'nav_signup', 'login', 'starter_plan_signup', 'pro_plan_signup', 'agency_plan_signup', 'pricing_page'.
- Deprecated trigger sources: 'creator_plan_signup' (must not be used).
- Frontend plan unions must always be: 'trial' | 'starter' | 'pro' | 'agency'.
- Backend `UserPlan` enum must mirror: TRIAL, STARTER, PRO, AGENCY.
- Periodically grep for 'creator' and invalid unions to prevent regressions.

## **üßπ CODE DEBT CLEANUP STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR BOOTSTRAPPED PRODUCTS)**
- **No Backward Compatibility**: Since we're not live, remove all legacy methods and unused functions immediately.
- **Unused Code Detection**: Use grep to find functions like `upgradeUserToCreator` that are no longer called anywhere.
- **LemonSqueezy Cleanup**: Remove all references to 'creator' in product names, variant names, and plan detection logic.
- **Copy Consistency**: Update all UI text from "Creator plan" to "Starter plan" or appropriate plan names.
- **Legacy Method Removal**: Delete unused private methods, update plan detection to only look for valid plan names.
- **Build Verification**: Always run build after cleanup to ensure no broken references remain.

## **üìç WORKING DIRECTORY AWARENESS (CRITICAL FOR ACCURATE FILE OPERATIONS)**
- **Always use `pwd` before running commands or creating files** to confirm current location in codebase.
- **Verify working directory** before any file operations to prevent creating files in wrong locations.
- **Check current directory** before running builds, tests, or file searches to ensure accurate results.
- **Working directory context** is essential for proper file paths and command execution.

## **üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS**
- **Global State Management**: Current AppContext is EXCELLENT - no need for external libraries
- **Payment Integration**: LemonSqueezy - already integrated in backend, no additional infrastructure needed
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Must be rock-solid before proceeding with features

## **üèõÔ∏è CLEAN ARCHITECTURE & SOLID (CRITICAL)**
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate Domain (entities, policies), Application (use-cases/services), and Infrastructure (controllers, DB, external APIs). The dependency rule: source code dependencies point inward.
- **Ports & Adapters**: Define interfaces (ports) for external systems: `ContentGeneratorPort` (AI), `PaymentProviderPort` (LemonSqueezy), `CachePort` (Redis), `MonitoringPort` (logs/metrics). Implement adapters in Infrastructure.
- **SOLID Principles**:
  - Single Responsibility: Each class/service does one thing (e.g., plan determination vs. subscription updates vs. analytics logging).
  - Open/Closed: Prefer extension via new adapters/policies over modifying core use-cases.
  - Liskov Substitution: Ports have substitutable implementations (e.g., mock AI generator in tests).
  - Interface Segregation: Small, focused interfaces per capability.
  - Dependency Inversion: Domain/Application depend on abstractions, not concrete frameworks.
- **Modularity Rules**:
  - Controllers are thin; business logic lives in services/use-cases.
  - Never inject a repository into another repository; prefer services as boundaries.
  - Avoid cross-module repository access; use exported services from the owning module.
  - Keep DTO mapping at boundaries; entities stay in the domain.
  - No static helpers that hit the database; always go through services.

## **ü§ñ AI INFRASTRUCTURE & RELIABILITY (CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION)**

### **Multi-Provider Strategy V1 (August 2025 - Cost-Optimized)**
- **Primary Provider**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite ($0.10 input + $0.40 output per 1M tokens)
  - Purpose: Creative content generation, primary UGC creation
  - Quality: Excellent for social media content, most cost-effective
- **Speed Provider**: Groq Llama 4 Scout ($0.11 input + $0.34 output per 1M tokens)
  - Purpose: Fast responses, overflow capacity, real-time generation  
  - Performance: 18x faster inference, good quality for speed-critical tasks
- **Premium Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4o Mini ($0.15 input + $0.60 output per 1M tokens)
  - Purpose: Complex requests, premium quality, fallback for difficult tasks
  - Quality: Highest quality output, used sparingly for cost control

### **Token Management & Cost Control (August 2025)**
- **Per Generation Allocation**: 1,000 input + 2,000 output tokens (3,000 total)
- **Cost Per Generation**: ~$0.0008-0.0015 (less than 0.2 cents per generation)
- **Monthly AI Costs**: $15-50 for 100+ users (99%+ profit margins maintained)
- **Safety Measures**: Hard budget caps, real-time monitoring, automatic alerts

### **Flexible Architecture Requirements**

- **Evolution Strategy**: Start cost-optimized, upgrade to premium models as revenue grows  
- **A/B Testing Ready**: Can test different model combinations for quality/cost optimization
- **Provider Orchestrator**: Intelligent routing based on request type, load, cost, and quality requirements
+
+## **üîÑ JOB QUEUES & RETRY INFRASTRUCTURE (CRITICAL FOR SCALABILITY)**
+- **Job Queue System**: Essential for AI generation scaling - cannot build without it
+  - **Bull/BullMQ**: Redis-based job queues with retry, delay, and priority support
+  - **Job Types**: AI generation, email notifications, analytics processing, cleanup tasks
+  - **Queue Priorities**: High (user-facing), Medium (background), Low (maintenance)
+- **Retry Mechanism**: Comprehensive tracking and intelligent retry strategies
+  - **Database Tracking**: Store retry attempts, failure reasons, provider used, cost incurred
+  - **Exponential Backoff**: Smart retry delays (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, max 30s)
+  - **Provider Rotation**: Switch providers on consecutive failures
+  - **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily disable failing providers to prevent cascade failures
+- **Job Monitoring**: Real-time queue health, job success rates, processing times
+- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling of job workers, load balancing across instances
+- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor AI costs per job, per provider, per user plan
+
+## **üíæ RETRY & FAILURE TRACKING STRATEGY**
+- **Redis Storage**: Fast access to retry counts, failure patterns, provider health
+- **Database Persistence**: Long-term tracking for analytics and cost optimization
+- **Failure Analytics**: Identify patterns (provider issues, user input problems, rate limits)
+- **User Experience**: Never show "AI is down" - always attempt fallback providers
+- **Cost Transparency**: Track and report costs to users (especially for trial users hitting limits)
