## Performance Targets üéØ

### API Response Times
- [ ] Generation endpoint: < 10 seconds
- [ ] Auth endpoints: < 500ms
- [ ] Team operations: < 1 second
- [ ] Payment webhooks: < 2 seconds

### Frontend Performance
- [ ] First Contentful Paint: < 2 seconds
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint: < 3 seconds

### Cost Efficiency
- [ ] API costs: ‚â§ $50 initially (target: $0.50 per generation)
- [ ] 66% cost reduction via variations optimization
- [ ] Zero-cost features provide 70%+ of user value

## Database Setup üóÑÔ∏è

### Required Tables
- [ ] `users` - User accounts and plan information
- [ ] `generations` - Ad generations and history
- [ ] `teams` - Team management (Agency feature)
- [ ] `team_members` - Team membership and roles
- [ ] `shared_generations` - Team shared content

### Indexes for Performance
```sql
-- User lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_plan ON users(plan);

-- Generation queries
CREATE INDEX idx_generations_user_id ON generations(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_generations_created_at ON generations(created_at);

-- Team operations
CREATE INDEX idx_team_members_user_id ON team_members(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_team_members_team_id ON team_members(team_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_shared_generations_team_id ON shared_generations(team_id);
```

## Monitoring & Analytics üìä

### Key Metrics to Track
- [ ] User signups per day
- [ ] Demo completions vs. signups
- [ ] Plan upgrade rates
- [ ] Daily/monthly active users
- [ ] Generation usage by plan
- [ ] API costs vs. revenue
- [ ] Feature adoption rates

### Error Monitoring
- [ ] API error rates
- [ ] Payment webhook failures
- [ ] Generation timeouts
- [ ] Authentication issues
- [ ] Database connection errors

## LemonSqueezy Integration üí∞

### Webhook Events
- [ ] `subscription_created` - Upgrade user plan
- [ ] `subscription_updated` - Handle plan changes
- [ ] `subscription_cancelled` - Downgrade to free
- [ ] `order_created` - Handle one-time purchases

### Product Setup
- [ ] Create products for each tier
- [ ] Set custom data with plan identifiers
- [ ] Configure webhook URLs
- [ ] Test webhook signature verification

## Deployment Steps üöÄ

### 1. Database Deployment
```bash
# Create production database
createdb hookly_production

# Run migrations
npm run migration:run

# Verify tables created
psql hookly_production -c "\dt"
```

### 2. Backend Deployment
```bash
# Build application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Verify health check
curl https://your-backend-url.com/health
```

### 3. Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Build application
npm run build

# Deploy to hosting service (Vercel/Netlify)
npm run deploy

# Verify deployment
curl https://your-frontend-url.com
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test complete user flow: Demo ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Generation ‚Üí Upgrade
- [ ] Verify webhook endpoints receive test events
- [ ] Check error monitoring is active
- [ ] Confirm analytics tracking works
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Verify SSL certificates

2. Add connection pooling
3. Optimize slow queries
4. Scale database resources

### High Error Rates
1. Check service status
2. Review error logs
3. Rollback if needed
4. Scale resources
