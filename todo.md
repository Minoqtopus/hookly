## **üö® CRITICAL ALIGNMENT ALERT**

**The codebase is currently MISALIGNED with our strategic roadmap. Before any new development can proceed, we must complete Tier 0 (Critical Codebase Alignment) tasks.**

### **Current Misalignments:**
- **UserPlan Enum**: Current `TRIAL/CREATOR/AGENCY` vs Expected `TRIAL/STARTER/PRO/AGENCY`
- **Pricing Strategy**: Current `$29/$79` vs Expected `$19/$59/$129`
- **Test Infrastructure**: Backend 100% failure rate, frontend 85% success rate
- **Missing Infrastructure**: Signup control, Redis cache, advanced prompt engineering
- **Feature Flags**: Incomplete platform-specific features

### **Impact:**
- **Cannot build new features** on broken foundation

- **Tier 5**: 4 hours (Testing Strategy)

## **üéØ STRATEGIC PRIORITIZATION PHILOSOPHY**

### **Development Workflow Principles**
1. **Foundation First**: Fix infrastructure before building features
2. **Copy Consistency Early**: Establish brand voice before user-facing features
3. **Legal Compliance First**: GDPR/CCPA before any user data collection
4. **AI Quality Foundation**: Core competitive advantage before revenue features
5. **Performance After Core**: Optimize only after core functionality works
6. **Revenue Features Last**: Build revenue features on solid foundation

### **Why This Order Matters**
- **Copy Consistency** must come before **AI Quality** to ensure consistent brand voice
- **Legal Compliance** must come before **User Features** to prevent regulatory issues
- **Performance Optimization** must come after **Core Functionality** to avoid premature optimization
- **Revenue Features** must come last to ensure they're built on solid, tested foundation

## **üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE SCHEMA STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SCALABILITY)**

### **Schema Design Principles**
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add new features without breaking existing user data
- **Backward Compatibility**: Schema changes must not affect current users
- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable features per user plan without data loss
- **Soft Deletes**: Never permanently delete user data, use soft deletes for compliance
- **JSONB Flexibility**: Use JSONB for extensible data that may change frequently

### **Critical Schema Requirements**
- **UserPlan Enum**: Must support STARTER, PRO, AGENCY with easy expansion
- **Feature Flags**: Scalable system for enabling/disabling features per plan

### **Database Migration Strategy (CRITICAL)**
- **Migration Control**: I will NEVER generate migrations - only identify when needed
- **Manual Migration**: You will generate and run all migrations manually
- **Non-Breaking Changes**: All entity changes must be carefully designed to be non-breaking
- **Synchronize False**: NEVER set synchronize to true - always work with proper migrations
- **Backward Compatibility**: All schema changes must maintain existing user data integrity
- **Migration Planning**: I will identify migration needs and provide detailed change specifications

### **Environment Variable Strategy (CRITICAL)**
- **Environment Variable Everything**: All configurable values must be environment variables
- **No Hardcoded Values**: Zero tolerance for hardcoded configuration in production code
- **Production Stability**: Environment variables prevent configuration issues during releases
- **Configuration Management**: All API keys, URLs, limits, and settings must be environment-driven
- **Release Safety**: Environment variables ensure smooth production deployments

### **Development Workflow Strategy (CRITICAL)**
- **Database-First Approach**: Always plan schema before implementation, never hardcode data
- **Real Data Only**: Use seeded data from database, never hardcoded dummy values
- **Dynamic Content**: All UI content must come from database or environment variables
- **Test Data Management**: Use MCP server for seeding realistic test data across all user types
- **Production Safety**: Eliminates hardcoded data that could break in production

### **Security Strategy (CRITICAL)**
- **Security First**: Security must be top-notch across the entire codebase
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries and ORM, never raw SQL
- **XSS Protection**: Sanitize all user-generated content
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement proper CSRF tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and brute force attacks
- **Authentication Security**: Secure JWT implementation, proper token refresh
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Regular security testing and penetration testing

### **Exclusive Signup Control Strategy (CRITICAL FOR BOOTSTRAPPED GROWTH)**
- **Signup Limiting**: Control total signups allowed to prevent viral bankruptcy
- **Database Storage**: Store total_signups_allowed and total_signups_completed in database
- **Real-time Validation**: Pre-fetch availability on landing page, validate at signup
- **Exclusive Positioning**: Create FOMO and premium perception through scarcity
- **Sustainable Scaling**: Increase limits systematically based on profitability
- **User Management**: Delete inactive users to free up slots for new signups
- **Cost Control**: Prevent viral explosion from exceeding operational budget
- **Growth Strategy**: Systematic scaling aligned with revenue and capital availability

### **Performance & Monitoring Strategy (CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION)**
- **Strategic Redis Caching**: Cache only high-impact, frequently accessed data
- **No Over-Caching**: Avoid caching everything - focus on performance bottlenecks
- **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexes for query performance without over-indexing
- **Local Monitoring First**: File-based logging and monitoring to save costs early
- **Mixpanel Analytics**: User behavior tracking and conversion analytics
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, database queries, cache hit rates
- **Cost-Effective Scaling**: Local solutions until profitable, then third-party services
- **Production Readiness**: Monitor everything critical for production stability

## **üí° ENGINEERING APPROACH**

This approach follows engineering best practices with TDD:
1. **Fix infrastructure first** (API endpoints)
2. **Setup testing foundation** (comprehensive test suite)
3. **Build core functionality** (dashboard features) with tests
4. **Complete the system** (missing pages) with tests
5. **Validate and polish** (E2E testing and refinement)
