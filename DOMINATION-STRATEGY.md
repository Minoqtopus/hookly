## 🎨 **FRONTEND INTEGRATION PATTERNS**

### **Enhanced API Consumption**

```typescript
// Product URL Analysis
const analyzeProduct = async (productUrl: string) => {
  const response = await api.post('/generation/enhanced/analyze-product', {
    product: { productUrl }
  });
  
  // Handle loading states, errors, fallbacks
  if (response.success) {
    setProductAnalysis(response.analysis);
    setSuggestedAngles(response.suggested_angles);
    setOptimalPlatforms(response.optimal_platforms);
  }
};

// Enhanced Content Generation
const generateContent = async (request: EnhancedGenerationRequest) => {
  const response = await api.post('/generation/enhanced/generate', request);
  
  // Display viral insights
  setViralScore(response.content.estimated_performance.viral_score);
  setViralElements(response.viral_insights.viral_elements);
  setEngagementHooks(response.viral_insights.engagement_hooks);
  
  // Show optimization suggestions
  setOptimizations(response.viral_insights.optimization_suggestions);
};
```

### **Progressive Enhancement UX**
