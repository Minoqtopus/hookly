# Hookly: Pricing Strategy for Capital-Efficient Growth to $10M

## Core Philosophy: The "Capital-Efficient Premium" Model

With a maximum initial investment of $500 and a goal of $10M in revenue, our strategy must be ruthlessly efficient. It is built on three pillars:

1.  **Product-Led Growth (PLG)**: The product itself is our primary marketing and sales engine.
2.  **Immediate Time-to-Value**: Users must experience a "magic moment" of value within the first 60 seconds.
3.  **Obsessive Focus on LTV:CAC**: We must acquire customers for pennies and retain them for years.
