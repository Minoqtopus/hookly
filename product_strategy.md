## **üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE & INFRASTRUCTURE**

### **Current Infrastructure (Bootstrapped)**
- **Backend**: Render (scalable, cost-effective)
- **Frontend**: Vercel (excellent for Next.js, global CDN)
- **Database**: Neon (PostgreSQL, serverless, cost-effective)
- **Monthly Cost**: ~$50-100/month
- **Migration Plan**: Move to AWS EC2 when MRR hits $5K+ (better for enterprise features)

### **Frontend Stack**
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **State Management**: React Context API + useReducer (excellent design, no external libraries needed)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + comprehensive test suite
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens, working correctly

### **Backend Stack**
- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens, working correctly
- **Payment Integration**: LemonSqueezy (already implemented)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for content generation
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive test coverage

### **Clean Architecture & SOLID (Engineering Standard)**
- **Clean Architecture Layers**:
  - Domain: Entities, enums, business policies (e.g., `User`, `UserPlan`, plan features)
  - Application: Use-cases/services orchestrating domain rules (e.g., generation, payments, user plans)
  - Infrastructure: Controllers, repositories, external adapters (OpenAI, LemonSqueezy, Redis, Mixpanel)
- **Dependency Rule**: Inner layers know nothing about outer layers. Application depends on interfaces, not implementations.
- **Ports/Adapters**:
  - ContentGeneratorPort (AI) ‚Üí OpenAIService adapter
  - PaymentProviderPort (billing) ‚Üí LemonSqueezy adapter
  - CachePort ‚Üí RedisService adapter
  - MonitoringPort ‚Üí LogViewer/Monitoring adapter
- **SOLID Principles**: Enforced across services and modules. Thin controllers, cohesive services, small interfaces, dependency inversion by default.
- **Modularity Rules**: Never import a repository into another repository; always communicate via services. Keep modules autonomous and interact through public service APIs.

### **Database Design**
- **User Management**: Trial, Creator, Agency plans with feature flags
- **Content Generation**: Hooks, scripts, visuals with performance tracking
- **Templates**: Reusable content structures with usage analytics
- **Team Features**: Collaboration and sharing capabilities
- **Analytics**: Performance tracking and user behavior analysis

### **Database Migration Strategy (CRITICAL)**
- **Migration Control**: All migrations generated and run manually by you, never auto-generated
- **Non-Breaking Changes**: All entity changes must maintain backward compatibility
- **Synchronize False**: Never use synchronize: true - always work with proper migrations
- **Data Integrity**: All schema changes must preserve existing user data
- **Migration Planning**: Detailed specifications provided for manual migration generation
